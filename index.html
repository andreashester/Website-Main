          <p class="text-left">
            Born in Santa Barbara, California, Andreas Hester was always exposed
            to deep music culture from childhood by way of his father, and that followed him through
            his life. Beginning with a bigger drive to learn classical cello
            outside of elementary school, he quickly developed an interest in
            the double bass, but not in the same classical styles that he got
            started with. Instead, he chose to switch over to the jazz space,
            and later, a wider involvement in almost all the musical endeavors
            available to him in high school, namely pit orchestras for musicals
            and percussion theater. In his time attending the California
            Insitute of the Arts for his undergreaduate degree in Jazz studies,
            he tries to explore more modern facets of the style, mainly through
            fusion and freer improv. However, his new main gig is applying this
            language to his current band, Precipice, a rock group formed in 2022
            with CalArts alum Oliva Fries-Farr, which has recently gotten
            started with shows around the L.A. area.

      <h4 class="subheading">My ethos:</h4>
    
        <p class="text-right">In not just music, but all art, the boundaries in-between genres has always been
            a point of
            interest for me. As a way to identify the broad strokes in a medium, they can be useful in highlighting
            stylistic qualities and easing people into experiencing new work. However, I also worry that attaching
            yourself to one place for too long can make moving out feel too overwhelming, especially when the
            expectations of those around you seem to keep you stuck even more. Many of my favorite works, then, tend
            to
            be those with a knack for crossing between these rifts, often merging genres together, and, in turn, I
            find
            a lot of inspiration and value in doing so myself. This is not to say that the solution is to ignore
            definition entirely, lest you end up creating something that feels formless. Rather, it’s through
            acknowledging these distinctions that one can be given the chance to make something truly unique.
            Embrace
            the variety, but don’t be held down in one place. The transition I’ve slowly made from jazz to rock has
            felt
            like a test of that flexibility. Currently, while I haven’t composed for Precipice, my current primary
            focus, our music still straddles those lines already, and I’ve had a lot of freedom to experiment with
            my
            language, in turn. I hope to translate that into my own work soon.</p>
